  set design; pipelining, processor design; hard-wired and
  microprogrammed control; memory hierarchies; input/output systems;
  multiprocessors. Prerequisite: CS 550  (Computer Organization and
  Programming) or equivalent.

  Homework and Exams: There will be several (approximately eight)
  homework assignments. Each is like a take-home exam as it shapes
  about 7% of the grade. Students are expected to work individually on
  assignments. Homework may have a different weight depending on the
  size of topics and assignment.

  There will be two exams, a midterm exam, and a final exam. The final
  exam is comprehensive, but a fair amount of emphasis will be placed
  on the second part of the course.

    Grade: Your final grade will be broken down as follows:
    Homework 50%, Midterm Exam 25%, Final Exam 25%.
    Performance of 90% guarantees an A, 80% a B, and 70% a C.
